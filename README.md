# chess
A chessbot using the sepia game engine. 
Because the sepia engine is not designed to play chess, there is a lot of mechanics that are hidden that enable chess to be played.
Most of the "sepia-ness" is hidden so the code is relatively simple to understand. 
I've only added the agent code, heuristics, and custom move ordering code.
